A plugin for Mongoose to deep check and only set properties on a model that have changed

## ðŸš¨ DEPRECATED ðŸš¨ 
This package is deprecated and no longer maintained

## Installation

You can install this package using `yarn` or `npm`.

```shell
#yarn
yarn add @meanie/mongoose-set-properties

#npm
npm install @meanie/mongoose-set-properties --save
```

## Usage

Setup as a global plugin for all Mongoose schema's:

```js
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const setProperties = require('@meanie/mongoose-set-properties');

mongoose.plugin(setProperties);
```

Or for a specific (sub) schema:

```js
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const setProperties = require('@meanie/mongoose-set-properties');
const {Schema} = mongoose;

const MySchema = new Schema({});
MySchema.plugin(setProperties);
```

Then use when setting updated properties on your documents:

```js
//Get document
const myDoc = await mongoose.model('MyModel').find({});

//Get updated data
const data = {some: 'New', or: 'Updated', properties: [1, 2, 3]};

//Only modify properties that have changed
myDoc.setProperties(data);

//Check modified paths to verify
const modified = myDoc.modifiedPaths();

//Save
await myDoc.save()
```

For more details around behaviour, see the source code and test cases of the [internal helpers](https://github.com/meanie/mongoose-set-properties/tree/master/helpers).

## Background

The motivation for this plugin was a bug in Mongoose that would improperly mark all fields of a sub document as modified, even if none of the field values in the sub document had actually changed. This issue has since been fixed, but Mongoose still doesn't do a deep equality check, and the plugin has some additional features that make comparing sub documents easier.
